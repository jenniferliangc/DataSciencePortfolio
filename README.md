# DataSciencePortfolio

A collection of Data Science and Data Analytic projects to demonstrate my skill set.

## Contents
* ### _Machine Learning_
  **Using Python and Pandas:**
     * **Bank Marketing Prediction**: Trained several machine learning models to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaigns. Some of the models trained are: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest (optimized using cross-validation), and neural networks 
     * **Predicting Housing Prices**: Built a linear model to predict house sale prices from a dataset with over 500,000 datapoints and 61 variables
     
  **Using R:**
    * **Cities**: Used a public dataset with agreggated data for each of Brazil's cities such as population, gdp, number of cars, among others, to create a linear model that predicts the population for each city
    * **Baseball Analysis**: Used libraries such as infer, ggplot2, and tidyverse to perform exploratory data analysis and create a linear model that predicts baseball wins using different independent variables

* ### _Data Analysis_
  **Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn:**
    * **Bike Sharing**: Analyzed bike sharing data from Washington D.C. to gain insight about user's behavior
    * **Text Analysis Using Twitter**: Produced tweets' sentiment score using VADER lexicon to predict how positive or negative a tweet is
    * **Tuscan RFM Marketing Analysis**: Took a merchant's dataset and split customers into deciles to identify most profitable customers based on their recency, frequency and monetary values. Calculated gross profit and ROI across all customer segments
   
  **Using R:**
    * **Flights**: Took a data set with 113k rows and 19 variables with information about departing flights in the US and analyze the impact that COVID-19 had on flights and some general statistics
    * **People's Park**: Used a data set provided by the Chancellor's Office at University of California, Berkeley with anonymized responses from 1,250 students from a survey designed to get some data on student's perspective on the ongoing controversy of the People's Park project and summarized the survey responses 
    * **Hypothesis Testing Using P-Values**: Permuted datasets and the desired statistic to compute p-values and reject or accept null hypothesis for different datasets using the infer library
